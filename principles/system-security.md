# System Security

The second part focuses on methodological engineering of security properties of distributed systems based on
security policies and their formal models. In an early stage of the engineering process formal security models are
used for the precise and unambiguous representation of security policies which then are analyzed by static
model checking and simulative model execution. Successful models afterwards are transformed via specification
languages into executable code which finally is integrated into a system's trusted computing base.

Course topics are

* requirements analysis
* security policies and formal security models
* model engineering
* security mechanisms
* security architectures
