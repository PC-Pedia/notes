## Getting Noticed/Contact Information

* Find your recruiter here: https://careers.microsoft.com/recruiters
* General recruiting email/contact email for schools without dedicated recruiters: URCenter@microsoft.com
* If you have a Microsoft-employee-friend willing to give you a referral, have them send your resume, your top accomplishments, and desired role(s) at Microsoft to collref@microsoft.com (only for college internships and new grads within +/-1 year of graduation)

If you were referred, **make sure you apply online also**. The application is basically only a resume upload--it takes literally about 5-10 minutes. There's no reason not to fill it out when it could massively expedite your interview and hiring process (potentially gets you noticed faster).

## Statistics

From online application through to hire stage, the acceptance rate for Internship and New Grad roles is approximately 1-2%. The probability of cold applying online to getting a phone screen is about 10%. The probability of making it past the phone screen to final loop interviews is about 40%. The probability of receiving an offer from the final loop stage is a few points less than 50%.

## Interview Process

So you've been contacted for an interview. Congrats! This process begins in one of two ways: first with either a phone screen or a campus interview. Phone screens are typically non-technical or close-to-non-technical 30 minute conversations with a recruiter. See the section below for a sampling of questions. Campus interviews can be **more technical** despite being about the same amount of time; candidates are typically given an easy/moderate (Leetcode equivalent) technical question by an engineer to solve in real time or to code and hand-in for future evaluation. It appears as though this is done mostly at target schools and/or where there are large volumes of qualified candidates to sort through in short amounts of time (big state schools, etc).

## Interview Day

On interview day your recruiter will tell you what building and time to meet them at. You'll have anywhere between 3-5, interviews,
including lunch with one of your interviewers (which is also an interview).

Here's some tips to live by:

* Pseudocode an answer before writing it. This can be your list of steps in your algorithm as well as the requirements your algorithm must meet in order to be successful. I personally write a list that I can check off as I go through it, that way I don't forget what I was going to do. With that, some interviewers may accept pseudocode as your answer.

* Catch edge cases where they'll impact your core algorithm. It's a whiteboard, so when you write one answer you can easily go back and add or erase where you see fit.

* You will be asked to optimize your solution no matter what. If you think you can create the most optimal solution as your initial answer, go for it. If not, just create some solution that will work and mention that you plan on optimizing it later (if you have time). The team I interviewed with cared that I got /some/ answer on the board, especially if we were low on time.

## Interview Question Examples

Assume any questions asked for Explore are also fair game for SWE/etc, since they are in theory "easier".

### Phone Screen round

1. What is your favorite technology and why?
2. What teams at Microsoft are you interested in and why?
3. How did you become interested in computer science?
4. What is a linked list?
5. What is your favorite language and why?
6. (Explore) You work in an ice cream shop and step into the back for a few minutes. You return and see a large group of people waiting. How do you serve them?
7. (Explore) How would you make a multimedia cookbook for a family of varying cooking skills and abilities?

### Explore - PM-y questions (final rounds)
Cracking the PM Interview is overdoing it, but good prep for future PM candidates (you will need to re-interview from Explore to be considered for a return offer in a PM role).

1. If you were given a keyboard, how would you test the keys?
2. How would you test a pen?
3. How would you design a calculator for a visually impaired student?
4. How would you design a vending machine or a toaster?
5. You have a series of numbers from one to one million and there is a missing number; how would you find the missing number? (Solution can also be coded as part of the tech interviews)
6. In 2 to 3 minutes, explain a computer to a 5 year old who has seen a computer, but doesnâ€™t really understand what it is or does.
7. What is the difference between C and Java/between C and C# and how might this impact design decisions?

### Explore - Dev questions (final rounds)

Cracking the Coding Interview is likely overdoing it, but good prep for future interviews elsewhere (note that Explorers interested in returning as a SWE Intern within the same team do not need to re-interview).

1. What is the best data structure for a phone book with names and phone numbers? Code an example solution and explain.
2. Print values in a doubly linked list in descending order.
3. Invert a binary search tree.
4. Sort an array, stack, and queue in arrays and linked lists.
5. Write a program that returns the acute angle between two hands on a clock.
6. Keep track of the positions of people in a line. (Note that some questions asked are intentionally vague; ask clarifying questions. Can we consider this a sorted list? I.e. are they allowed to move around or not? What does that movement look like? That detail matters.)
7. Remove duplicates in this list.
8. Reverse a string.

### SWE Intern questions (final rounds)

Cracking the Coding Interview is good prep. Leetcode Hard is over-doing it.

1. Given two integers m and n, loop repeatedly through an array of m and remove each nth element. Return the last element left. (If m = 7 and n = 4, then begin with the array 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and remove, in order, 4 1 6 5 2 7 and return 3.)
2. Given an array of 0's and 1's, move all of the 0's to the beginning of the array and all of the 1's to the end of the array. 
3. Write a function that accepts an m x n matrix (array) of random numbers, and use the functions row (times) 2 and column-1 to set the entire array to 0.
4. Solve a maze recursively.
5. Solve the N Queens problem.
6. Keep track of the X most recent entries to a list without duplicates (sometimes framed as a line problem).
7. Find the longest palindrome in a string.

## Scheduling

**I recommend you schedule your phone screen no later than the third week of October, and fly-out final rounds to be completed no later than the first week of November**. This advice is **especially** emphasized for candidates interviewing for the Explore program; there are only ~300 Explorer spots, while there are nearly 1.7-2k SWE Intern spots. Explorer spots go very quickly; I've seen PLENTY of top students at top schools do exceptionally well in interviews only to be turned away because they waited until December to complete the rounds and all the spots got taken out from under them in the meantime. (Likewise, don't do this if you're seeking a PM role, either. Those figures are similar and as the PM program is extraordinarily competitive, I recommend not waiting.)

## Team Placement (Internships)

Team placement works similarly to Google and Facebook in that you do not (typically-- maybe 99% of the time) have the option of interviewing for a specific team; you interview at the company, for a role. You can indicate your choices to your recruiter should you receive an offer (whether or not those choices will make any impact is another story. The tl;dr is that it probably will not). In my experience, most of the people I've known who accepted their offers ended up on teams related to the teams their interviewers are on (same "group" within Microsoft--for instance, SQL Server and COSMOS DB are within the same group but are not the same exact team). This has not held true in all cases, however. 

When you list team preferences, you should list realistic choices for your best chance at being happy with your placement (and keep in mind that stating preferences may make no impact at all. You may be a front-end engineer and get placed on SQL Server; you may be heavy back-end and get placed on PowerPoint UI. It's happened, and with relative frequency). Recruiters will likely reference your list for placement if they can, but again, you may or may not get your exact choices: and the more unrealistic you are, the higher the likelihood you get put somewhere unrelated. This means you **should not** list XBox, HoloLens, or Microsoft Research teams (unless you are a Research Intern--which is the PhD internship--for the latter). Everyone wants those teams, so basically no one gets put on them. It's a better strategy to list 5-10 realistic teams for your best shot.

## FAQ

**What happens if you get asked a question that you prepped for?**

Tell your interviewer. They might ask you to do it anyways, or they might have you do a different question.

**How long does it take to hear back from the company?**

Anywhere between the next day and 2 weeks. Poke your recruiter for updates if you don't hear back after a couple of days.

**How do team placements work?**

Team placement at Microsoft typically works with the teams you interviewed with. This process can be a bit disorganized. You may be someone with an interest in design or video games, and you end up interviewing with a team that focuses on data science. Microsoft is a massive company, and sometimes you don't end up somewhere that matches your interests.

**What happens if I don't get an offer?**

You keep moving forward. Learn from this process and take this knowledge to future interviews. Sometimes it's not your technical skills that were the problem, maybe your nerves were affecting you, maybe this team didn't have a project they felt you would want to work on or would work with your skills, it's not necessarily a bad thing that you didn't get an offer, it's a learning experience.
