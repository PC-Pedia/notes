### Scrum

* Start with minimal planning and Building and Release in several incremental releases (Sprint)
* 3 Roles: Product Owner, ScrumMaster, Team
* 3 Artifacts:
    * Product Backlog: Product owners create a prioritized list of features and ideas (User stories), This list could change after each sprint.
    * User stories: Is a feature request with details (As a__ I need__, So that__)
    * Burndown Chart: Shows progress of doing Tasks in Sprints. (It should reach 0 at the end of the project)
* 3 Ceremonies:
    * Sprint Planning: Owner, ScrumMaster, Team meet to discuss User stories and their priorities and their size.
    * Daily Scrum: Team meets to review what they have completed, and what they are working on, and if things are blocked and need help.
    * Sprint Review: Accures at the end of Sprint. Team demonstrate the work to the product owner and discuss what they can do to improve process going forward.
* Flow: Provide Product Backlog > Sprint Planning > Sprint Backlog > Sprint(With Daily Scrum) > ReleaseCandidate > Sprint Review (+ Retrospective: Things can do to improve the process)

### Sprint
